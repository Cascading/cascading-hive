Cascading-hive - Integration for Cascading and Apache Hive
==========================================================

Introduction to Cascading-hive
------------------------------

`Cascading-hive` provides integration between http://cascading.org[Cascading] and http://hive.apache.org[Apache Hive].

Many organizations have adopted Apache Hive, but until now one could not combine Hive based processes with Cascading
Apps. This project bridges the gap by making it possible to read and write Hive tables from within Cascading flows and
having Hive queries participating in a http://docs.cascading.org/cascading/2.5/userguide/html/ch03s09.html[`Cascade`].

The features of `Cascading-hive` include:

- run Hive queries within a Cascade (`HiveFlow`)
- read and write Hive tables within a Cascading Flow (`HiveTap`, `HiveTableDescriptor`)
- read and write partitioned Hive tables from a Cascading Flow (`HivePartitionTap`)
- deconstructing a Hive view into Taps (`HiveViewAnalyzer`)

With these features it is possible to combine existing Hive queries with new Cascading code and having the Cascading
planner run everything in the correct order.

The project maps Hive concepts like tables and running queries onto Cascading concepts like `Taps` and `Flows`.

The code of `Cascading-hive` is available on https://github.com/Cascading/cascading-hive/[github] and the jars are
deployed to http://conjars.org/repo/cascading/cascading-hive/[conjars].


Hive dependencies
-----------------

`Cascading-hive` works with hive-0.10+. When using the maven dependency you have to specify the version of Hive you are
using as a runtime dependency yourself.  This is done to avoid classpath issues with the various Hadoop and Hive
distributions in existence. The `demo` project introduced below contains an example of that.


Demo applications
-----------------

The https://github.com/Cascading/cascading-hive/tree/wip-1.0/demo[demo] directory of the project contains 3 applications
using `Cascading-hive` demonstrating the usage of the core classes to build applications with Cascading and Apache Hive.

.Hive MetaStore.
****
Please note that some features of Cascading-hive require a hosted Hive MetaStore. Therefore you should
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/AdminManual+MetastoreAdmin[configure one] before running any of the
demo applications.
****

You can assemble the hadoop ready jar file of the demos by checking out the repository and running the following
commands:

    > git clone https://github.com/Cascading/cascading-hive.git
    > cd cascading-hive/demo
    > gradle jar

Running the demo apps follows the standard hadoop way of running applications:

    >  hadoop jar build/libs/cascading-hive-demo-1.0.jar <main-class>


cascading.hive.HiveDemo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

https://github.com/Cascading/cascading-hive/blob/wip-1.0/demo/src/main/java/cascading/hive/HiveDemo.java[This demo]
shows how Cascading based data processing and Hive based processing can be combined to build one app based on
both technologies. The application does the following list of things:

1. define and create a table called `dual`
2. load existing data into `dual`
3. create a second table called `keyvalue`
4. populate the second table via SQL
5. create a third table called `keyvalue2`
6. populate `keyvalue2` with a pure Cascading flow that reads from `keyvalue`
7. use `JDBC` to read the data back from `keyvalue2`

All these steps, except the last, are happening in the same `Cascade`. Cascading can determine the dependencies between
the Hive flows and the Cascading flows and enables you to build more complex applications using Cascading and Hive.

cascading.hive.HivePartitionDemo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

https://github.com/Cascading/cascading-hive/blob/wip-1.0/demo/src/main/java/cascading/hive/HivePartitionDemo.java[This
demo] focusses on the support for partitioned tables. The app is dealing with a tab separated log file of a simulated
cloud service logging customers in regions. The goal is to create a Hive table that is partitioned based on the region
where a customer interaction happened. The following steps are involved:

1. load the log file onto HDFS
2. create a partitioned Hive table, that uses `region` as the partitioning column
3. read all data from the log file and populate the Hive table from a pure cascading flow
4. read all information about customers having interactions in the `ASIA` region via `JDBC`.
5. do the same as above, but in a Cascading flow


The app creates and reads a partitioned table and uses it via `JDBC` to demonstrate the support for partitioned tables in
cascading-hive.

cascading.hive.HiveViewDemo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

https://github.com/Cascading/cascading-hive/blob/wip-1.0/demo/src/main/java/cascading/hive/HiveViewDemo.java[This demo]
shows how to create a view within a Cascading based application. The application creates a view based on a
partitioned table (similar to `HivePartitionDemo`) and queries the view via `JDBC`.

.Hive views vs. Cascading.
****
Views are an interesting construct since they form a hybrid of a ressource and computation. When writing SQL, they
behave as if they were a ressource, yet in reality they are ad-hoc computation. Mapping these concepts onto the
Cascading world is not easy, since a ressource is represented by a `Tap` and computation is represented by a `Flow`.
Currently there is no clean way of representing views in Cascading, which is why the support is not as prominent as for
regular tables.

Nevertheless has `cascading-hive` a set of helper classes, which enable you to let view-based Hive queries be part of a
`Cascade`.
****

Testing
-------

`Cascading-hive` also provides useful classes, which you can use in your tests, when writing hybrid Hive and
Cascading applictions. Using
https://github.com/ConcurrentCore/cascading-hive/blob/wip-1.0/src/test/java/cascading/HiveTestCase.java[`HiveTestCase`]
as a base class for such a test is probably a good idea. Most of the tests in `cascading-hive` are using it.
